To compile: javac Main.java

To run: java Main <args>

where <args> are …
M, the machine size in words.P, the page size in words.S, the size of each process.
J, the ‘‘job mix’’.N, the number of references for each process.R, the replacement algorithm: lifo, random, or lru.

Note: The running program will expect there to be a file called random-numbers in the same directory as Main.java, otherwise it will exit.
